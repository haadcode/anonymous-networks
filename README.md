# anonymous-networks

## Introduction

Anonymous Networks is a proof-of-concept ***distributed, peer-to-peer chat application built on top of [IPFS](http://ipfs.io)***.

*"Anonymous"* as in no real-names, no emails. *"Anonymous"* **not** as in *"hide your traffic"*.

All content (messages, files, metadata) are saved in IPFS as files or objects.

There's currently a server that tracks the head (IPFS hash) of a linked list that enables traversing the history of a channel's messages. In future this will be replaced by IPNS.

The messages are encrypted by default. Currently there's only one key pair that is used for the crypto. This will change in the future once IPFS has keystore implemented.

### Features
- Channel-based chats, usernames
- Drag & drop files to a channel to share them
- Channel modes: password protection to read (Secret), password protection to write (Moderated, only channel "ops" can write)
- Native application on OSX and Linux (Electron)

## Requirements
- Node.js v4.2.x
- Chrome

For development

- Following npm modules installed globally: grunt-cli, mocha, electron-prebuilt
- g++, gcc, make (for building native modules)
- python 2 (for building, some native modules need it, node-fibers perhaps?)

## Run
```
npm install
node index.js
```

Open http://localhost:3001 in your browser

### Run Options
#### Enable Bots
(broken atm!)
```
node index.js --bots
```

#### Autologin
Create a file called `user.json` and add your wanted credentials:
```
{
  "username": "bot",
  "password": "password"
}
```

Start the program:
```
node index.js [--bots]
```

## Build
Build all:
```
grunt
```

Build for individual platforms:
```
grunt build_nodejs_osx
grunt build_nodejs_linux
grunt build_native_osx
grunt build_native_linux
```

The builds are in `dist/`

## UI
Build:
```
cd client/
npm install
grunt build
```

Dev:
```
cd client/
(npm install)
grunt serve
```

### Development in Electron
For UI development (webpack-dev-server in the Electron app).

Start the webpack dev server:
```
cd client/
grunt serve
```

Start Electron:
```
cd client/
(npm install electron-prebuilt  -g)
export ENV=dev
electron . 
```

Make sure you don't have the node.js version running and no client open the browser.

## TODO

## Backlog
- Fix browser file upload
- Skip lists for LL items in order to prevent channel history traversal to get stuck completely
- Fix "Unauthorized" bug after setting channel passwords
- Fix Electron non-dev flow
- Add notification bubbles to native app
- Display notifications when app is unfocused
- move message type from MetaInfo to Message.content
- SwarmStore
- Integrate with a running ipfs daemon (https://github.com/haadcode/anonymous-networks/issues/1)
- Tab to finish the username when writing
- If it's truly a linked list, you could take advantage of https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTtqKeVpgQ73KbeoaaomvLoYMP7XKemhTgPNjasWjfh9b/ for efficient seeking to any point in the history. (from Ion)
- Private messages (one-to-one messages)
- Add Katex/Mathjax support along with markdown (from davidar)
- Empty channels when no swarm peers. Notify the user that there are no peers atm., re-try logic in backend for connecting to peers if connection failed and there are 0 peers
- bug: UI <-> daemon connection state gets fckd
- feature: markdown as content type in messages (like files/lists)
- add caching of packages to go-ipfs / node install.js
- password for username is unclear (and buggy: can't enter no password)
- feature: download manager
- setting channel passwords is unclear
- cache UI fonts locally (package with the app)
  + http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8966740/how-to-host-google-web-fonts-on-my-own-server
- flashing "Anonymous" user name for a known user
- bug: slow internet makes the app respond slower (how ui elements appear, sending messages feedback delay, etc.)
- subcomandante needs to be platform-agnostic (remove #!/usr/bin/env node)
- bug: when node who posted head is offline and nobody else has the head hash, whole channel gets fckd
- convert MessageStore (UI) to ES6
- easier network setup than network.json
- timestamp weirdness, slow updates
- hook log4js to ws so that backend logs get to browser
- aliases for peer addresses, "known as"
- bug: loading time at join if there are new messages in network
- LAN connections not initiated (ipfs bug?)
- favorites view, add(/remove) to favorites, uses DirectoryView only, localStorage for storing Maps {hash,links}, check possibility to save to network
- fix autolinks for http://localhost:port (fix in react-autolink)
- add file progress notification (loading text)
- emoji auto-completion
- emoji descriptions to image alt (fix in react-emoji)
- fancy link preview
- change TransitionGroups to react-motion
- download a directory
- UI feedback for: connections status, adding file, loading messages, etc.
- use POST instead of GET where it makes sense

### Messages data structure
From the log on sending a message:
```
[DEBUG] - Sending message...
[DEBUG] - --- Message -------------------------------------------
[DEBUG] - To:      #GXmxYYp1AT5joyj1Zdb7f8WNEyQvnYwLJ9zKMdQzmqxN
[DEBUG] - Message: 'hello'
[DEBUG] - Hash:    QmZ3f9EcN7tHeD6EyzqrySj6KsbRPeDBFuBkBqT1Nx1PKV
[DEBUG] - Meta:    QmSWHUxa4ByDgW4AnrKdsVvqr151Vd9SYgZH1czpe4EAKc
[DEBUG] - -------------------------------------------------------
[DEBUG] - Message sent!
```

The message content is encrypted and saved as a separate ipfs object.

```ipfs object get QmZ3f9EcN7tHeD6EyzqrySj6KsbRPeDBFuBkBqT1Nx1PKV```

Returns:
```
{
  "Links": [],
  "Data": "{\"content\":\"Um/+VbM2ay0jxIZpjLzLung7nLbjOOmqonPZnbXd6zOz4QTvMYiUgtpe7X/0oTfy0w8m3981rfZSgX86onBX6724M6vxiHNI9nMD0gbwleAQV7BTx+5X3NqG0LFDeEW2iduwvanc0YJIpFLL5yYCRQUybc531n8/5hNk7obWvkd5kI8FST+j9S4SX0G5lz8rWiHrqR1QAo3c1g40V3fk2C9huOuMovn7YkhN+AWTKxjmkvd6dIbBVw0YnoSTzgpdkhHb2RWBi7z1kYfYSiPiqmPNQvBoMCe1Dm0o7y70ond/A+XqBAyX2JFHyt1XrB1SP6SCZs5OZk0P1/S31nxxdA==\",\"link\":null,\"ts\":1447339736170}"
}
```

A linked list "meta" object is created, link to the next message is added and the payload, as json, gets encrypted. The message gets signed with (sha512(payload, salt) + salt + sequence number, privkey). **Payload contains the hash to the actual content.** The hash of the created ipfs object is the head of the linked list. The head gets sent to server.

```ipfs object get QmSWHUxa4ByDgW4AnrKdsVvqr151Vd9SYgZH1czpe4EAKc```

Returns:
```
